## Description
This is a plugin created by team 0NE for sheetshuttle. At our client's request we created a plugin to gather data from a google sheet containing a Professor's gradebook. Our program sorts through that data, figuring out which students aren't doing well (If their overall grade is less than a 70%) then write a Academic Progress Report, that gives them a warning, telling them how many days they've missed and what assignments they didn't do well on (Received a score less than 60%), encouraging them to reach out to the Professor and see what they can do to improve their grade. It then sends out that report as a email to the student and their advisor. 

In order to make this possible we used:
- Python
- SheetShuttle
- The Google Sheets API
- The Gmail API

These are some challenges we faced, while designing this plugin:
